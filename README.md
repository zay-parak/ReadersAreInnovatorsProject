The Readers are Innovators Program is a collection of short stories, written by several authors over the years contributing to the Readers are Innovators Community 
by posting short stories to the company by mail. 
This project was done by myself and my team as our final system project when we were enrolled in an entry-level Java course at Van Zyl and Pritchard.
